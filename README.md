## Description
**ProduktivLineSimul** is a production line simulator for industry benchmarking. The goal of this project is to propose a open-source tool to simulate production lines.
This tool can provide a quick evaluation of an efficiency gain generaed by an equipment modification, but also can it helps understanding better products flows on a complex line layout and how a flow can impact another.

Every element is simulated with its own parameters like MTTR, MTBF, Availability, etc.

## Installation and Execution

The program can be executed on Windows without any installation.

## Usage

After opening the application, the default model is loaded. Other models will be released in the future.
To start the simulation, just click on the start button. The simulation is then started in real-time.

A 8-hours run can be simulated quicker, by clicking on the 8-hours simulation button.
